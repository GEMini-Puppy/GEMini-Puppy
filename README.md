- 👋 Hi, I’m @GEMini-Puppy
- 👀 I’m interested in ANDRO
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about ANDRO
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with other Gems
- 📫 How to reach me ... Uhm plz don't unless you're talking ANDRO!
- 😄 Pronouns: He/They
- ⚡ Fun fact: If ANDRO has a million Gems, then I am one of them. If ANDRO has 5 Gems, I'm one of them. If ANDRO has one Gem, then I'm THAT ONE. If ANDRO has no Gems, then that means I'm dead. 0 awards or 10 awards. Good performace or bad performance. I will always love and support you ! Even if the world stands against ANDRO !! Stream ANDRO!
